# Conditional_Adversarial_Network

The project is an implementation of the Conditional Gans explained in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784"> paper </a> of Mehdi Mirza and Simon Osindero.
In addition has also been implemented a crossvalidation using the *FJD* metric, in order to tune some hyperparameter.
All the details are in the <a href='https://github.com/simocampi/Conditional_Adversarial_Network/blob/master/Report.pdf'> report </a>
